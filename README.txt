Football Data Analytics Project


**INTRODUCTION**
Welcome to my first foray into data analysis. Throughout this project, I will delve into fundamental libraries 
such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The core focus will be on proficiently handling dataframes and employing 
graphical representations to visualize the data effectively.
